# Fitbit
Analysing activity levels with the Fitbit dataset

## Personal Informatics

> **_Among these people, is their daily step count higher if they are more active in the morning?_**

### Why it is important?
Researchers and health professionals can examine how individuals incorporate physical activity into their everyday schedules, gaining insights that can guide the development of strategies for promoting healthier behavior.

## Ethical analysis

### Stakeholder Analysis

#### Fitness and Wellness Researchers

____ 


**Description** 
> These stakeholders, ranging from professors and scientists to health industry professionals in academia and research institutions, possess expertise in physical activity and health.
  
**Why a Key Stakeholder** 
> These experts can analyze physical activity data, focusing on the link between morning and daily activity for insights into health benefits. Our data can inform their research and lifestyle recommendations.
  
**Potential Benefits** 
> Access to the data and analysis supports researchers in conducting longitudinal studies, leading to new academic insights and potentially attracting funding for fitness and wellness research.
  
**Potential Risks** 
> Inaccurate conclusions in fitness and wellness can stem from insufficient data analysis or misinterpretation, especially given limitations in generalizing findings from specific Fitbit user data. Privacy and ethical concerns may arise; researchers must prioritize anonymizing and handling data responsibly.


 
 #### FitBit
 
 ____ 
  
**Description** 
> FitBit is a leading manufacturer of fitness tracking devices, including the devices that were used by the 30 individuals in tracking their step counts for the current study. 
  
**Why a Key Stakeholder** 
> The outcome of current research may be directly related to the usage and effectiveness of their products. The findings of user patterns could impact their marketing strategies, product development, and user engagement.
  
**Potential Benefits** 
> FitBit could leverage these findings for targeted marketing campaigns, potentially boosting customer engagement and loyalty, and using insights to enhance their product offerings, gaining a competitive edge.
 
**Potential Risks** 
> Negative correlations can impact FitBit's marketing and user engagement, while positive correlations drive increased device usage. Privacy issues or data misuse can harm FitBit's reputation, and misinterpretations may lead to uninformed decisions.

### *Data characterisation*

**High Level Description & Rationale** 
> The data, generated between 03/12/2016 - 05/12/2016 from thirty FitBit users via Amazon Mechanical Turk surveys, provides minute-level physical activity, featuring attributes like 'Id' for participant ID (e.g., '1503960366'), 'ActivityHour' for recorded time (e.g., '4/12/2016 10:00'), and 'StepTotal' for step counts in that hour (e.g., '676'), and was chosen for its granularity, facilitating the exploration regarding the relationship between morning step counts and daily total step counts.
 
**Scale of Data** 
> The data was collected from 30 anonymized individuals. 31 days (12/04/2016 - 11/05/2016) of data were collected and step counts per hour were recorded in 'hourlySteps_merged.csv' and 'dailySteps_merged.csv', along with the respective individual id. 
 
**Data Resolution** 
> Dataset 'hourlySteps_merged.csv' captures activity data ('StepTotal') at an hourly resolution for a particular individual ('Id') and specific hour of the day ('ActivityHour'). <br> 
Dataset 'dailySteps_merged.csv' also captures activity data ('StepTotal), but in a daily resolution (24 hrs) for a particular individual ('Id') and date ('ActivityDay'). 
 
**Accuracy** 
> Accuracy of data is subject to the precision and accuracy of the Fitbit device that was used for current research. Hence, any discrepancies in device precision have the potential to affect the overall data accuracy and quality.
 
**Completeness** 
> The data contained some missing days for some individuals with particular 'Id' (e.g., the participant with id '234167796' did not have the full 31 days of data recorded). It also appeared that some of the recorded hourly steps were 0. This indicates possible incompleteness within the data. Therefore, it is important to note that this incompleteness may slightly impact our findings' accuracy.

### *Data ownership, access, privacy and its implications*

**Data ownership** 
> This concerns the rights and responsibilities linked to data. Each participant who contributed holds legal control, but FitBit or the study's conducting entity could gain legal control through a contract, including data generated by user consent. 

**Data Access** 
> Authorised entities (research organizer or FitBit corporation) may obtain, view, or use the collected data over a signed consent by the user. 

**Data privacy** 
> Data privacy laws require all parties to adhere to data protection regulations, including anonymization, encryption, and informed consent, to safeguard the rights and confidentiality of contributing individuals.

**Data Suitability**

> Given the nature of the problem and the data, the data is well-suited to address the driving problem, which concerns the potential correlation between morning and daily activity levels.
 
**Stakeholder Impact**

> The potential findings could impact both stakeholder groups by informing fitness and wellness recommendations for the public and driving FitBit's development of targeted products and user-centric features.
